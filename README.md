My poor implementations of a few successful neural networks.
I extensively used codes from either: https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2
                                      https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon

Start by downloading CIFAR-10 and change the folder data-dir.
cifar10-allcnn : This is code is me trying to reimplement a nervana neon implementation of: Striving for Simplicity: the All Convolutional Net by Jost Tobias Springenberg, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox and Martin Riedmiller.
